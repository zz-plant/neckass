## [Unreleased]
### Changed
- Iterated on tiny LLM humor tuning with punchier beat pools and stricter candidate scoring/selection so generated headlines land funnier more consistently.
- Tuned tiny local LLM headline generation to rank multiple candidates and prefer higher-humor outputs while still avoiding recent duplicates.
- Modernized the contributor/developer documentation set (`README`, `CONTRIBUTING`, `DEVELOPMENT`) with clearer workflow, architecture mapping, and validation guidance.
- Refreshed governance docs (`SECURITY`, `CODE_OF_CONDUCT`) with clearer reporting, response, and enforcement language.
- Updated `AGENTS.md` to reflect the current modular architecture and current agent guardrails.
