# Security Policy

## Supported versions
This is a small static site with no formal release process. Security fixes are applied to the default branch.

## Reporting a vulnerability
If you believe you’ve found a security vulnerability:
1. Open a GitHub issue with a clear description and reproduction steps.
2. If the issue includes sensitive details, please limit the information to essentials and mark it clearly.

We’ll acknowledge receipt and work toward a fix as quickly as possible.

## Security considerations
- The site is static and does not process user accounts or store server-side data.
- Third-party dependencies are minimal; review any updates carefully.
