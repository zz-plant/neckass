# Neckass Headlines

A playful, privacy-friendly headline generator that mixes curated favorites with an on-device “tiny LLM” mock for fresh ideas. Built as a static, zero-build site—open the HTML and you’re running.

## ✨ Highlights
- **Instant, offline-friendly**: no server required, no API calls. Headlines stay on-device.
- **Hybrid generation**: cycles through a curated catalog and an optional tiny LLM mock.
- **Share-ready**: copy, export, and share flows stay synced with the current headline.
- **Persistent navigation**: remembers your place with `localStorage`.

## 🚀 Quick start
1. Clone the repo.
2. Open `index.html` in a modern browser.
3. Click **Next** to cycle headlines or generate a fresh one.
