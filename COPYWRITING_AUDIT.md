# Copywriting Audit: User-Friendliness Hotspots

This audit flags UI copy that may be confusing, overly technical, or not clearly action-oriented for a general user.

## Priority copy to improve

| Current copy | Why it is not user-friendly | Suggested rewrite |
|---|---|---|
| `Rate this headline for the RLHF log.` | Uses internal ML jargon (`RLHF`) that most users will not understand. | `Rate this headline to help improve suggestions.` |
| `Copy RLHF log (0)` | Technical term (`RLHF log`) sounds developer-only and unclear. | `Copy feedback history (0)` |
| `Automation beta` | Vague and product-internal wording; users may not know what automates what. | `Automation tools (beta)` |
| `Run scripted workflows with the agent tools.` | Heavy technical language (`scripted workflows`, `agent tools`). | `Run advanced actions automatically.` |
| `Copy agent snippet` | "Snippet" is developer-centric and may not help non-technical users. | `Copy automation code` |
| `Join API waitlist` | `API` may be unfamiliar to non-technical audiences. | `Join developer waitlist` |
| `Growth metrics` | Business/internal term; not clear what users gain. | `Usage stats` |
| `Copy metrics snapshot` | `Snapshot` is abstract and technical. | `Copy usage summary` |
| `Updated RLHF label for this headline.` | Jargon (`RLHF label`) is difficult and unnatural in UI status text. | `Updated your rating for this headline.` |
| `Label a few headlines first, then copy the RLHF log.` | Complex and technical; asks user to understand internal data format. | `Rate a few headlines first, then copy your feedback history.` |

## Additional copy that can be softened

- `Daily desk streak: 1 day · Back tomorrow.` can be more natural as `Daily streak: 1 day · Come back tomorrow.`
- `Shuffle streak: 0 · Start.` can be more explicit as `Shuffle streak: 0 · Shuffle to begin.`
- `Command desk` can be clearer as `Quick actions`.

## Principle used

Prefer plain language that describes **what the user can do now**, avoid internal terms, and keep status feedback specific and reassuring.
